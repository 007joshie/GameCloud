		<h2>Welcome</h2>
		<br>
		<p> The demand for more programmers is growing. The world is becoming more and more digitalised and companies need programs for their products/games. There is insufficient supply of programmers to meet the industry demand. This is why I am creating a website that is aimed at Intermediate students to get them interested in computer science.</p>
		<br>
		<p>My goal is for you to visit this website and learn a lesson or two on why computer science is important, and why it powers our technical generation. Possibly even get you so interested that you want to start doing programming courses at a local computer club or even online. The ways to learn are limitless so give it you best shot, you never know, you could be a CEO of a major computer company one day.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Who loves games? Everyone does, but what is the best type of game? Gaming on computers of course! These virtually generated simulations are getting closer to being life like. Graphics are getting so good that it is almost too hard to tell a screenshot of a game to a real life photograph (considering that it is scenery). If you love gaming, then you may love creating your own game.</p>
		<br>
		<p>This website was brainstormed, designed, created, developed, refined to produce the final outcome. Many hours over many weeks have gone into this project and I am extremely proud of what I have accomplished.</P>
